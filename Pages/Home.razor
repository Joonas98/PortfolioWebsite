                <h1>Introduction - Joonas Suuronen</h1>
                <p>
                    Hello, and welcome to my portfolio website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm someone with a deep curiosity about the world — I’m genuinely interested in understanding how things work and discovering creative, out-of-the-box solutions. While I have a strong appreciation for subjects like psychology, history, and philosophy, my true passion lies in technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have a solid background in programming and a constant drive to learn and grow. Software development isn’t just a job for me — it's something I genuinely enjoy. Whether for work or personal growth, I’m always involved in exciting side projects and hobby-driven development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It may be a bit of a cliché, but one quote that resonates with me comes from Confucius: “Choose a job you love, and you’ll never have to work a day in your life.”
                </p>
